# Image Generation

This is an image generator, it works pretty well considering the hardware constraints.

Please note that sometimes the build script fails because it takes too long to download some of the needed components. If this happens simply start the container manually with "docker compose up", it should continue downloading what it needs with no time contraints. This is not bad for simple requests like making D&D VTT tokens or headshots of pretty girls. Anything more complex than that is things will get weird if not disturbing very quickly.
