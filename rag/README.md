# RAG Chatbot

A RAG agent is an AI you can upload documents to, it will index them and then answer questions for you. Keep in mind, this one uses a small LLM, so it is not very smart. This project was a proof of concept for me. The constrained hardware meant I had to work at it, to get something that worked consistantly. The nice thing about it, is it will scale, so if you have one of those nicer AI machines, you can change the build scipt to use a larger LLM, knowing the web frontend will not consume many resources.
