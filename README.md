# Jetson-Nano
Various AI projects for my Jetson Nano

I was lent a Dell Pro Max DG10 development system awhile back. I had it for about a week and it was a facinating piece of equipment. Unfortunately I did have to give it back, but the experience of having a machine like that strictly to develope AI applications was kind of fun. Also unfortunately, those things cost $4,000 which is outside of my budget. Fortunately, NVIDIA makes or rather made, smaller more affordable systems that serve the same purpose. Of course the Jetson Thor's and such were also out of my price range, but the Jetson Orin Nano came in at $250, not bad all things considered. Sure its not as powerful and leaves a lot of things to be desired, but for a little hobbyist toy, it works just fine for me.
