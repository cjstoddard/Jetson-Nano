# Eliza Chatbot: This program is for educational and entertainment only, it should never EVER be used in place of professional mental health care.

This app is an offshoot of the Eliza program, originally wrtten in 1964 by Joseph Weizenbaum. [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) is widely considered the worlds first chatbot and simulated a psychotherapist of the Rogerian school.

This Eliza is of course much better at what it does, however, of all of these projects, this one works the best. With the others I was not terribly worried about how well they worked, as they were just proof of concept projects, or a place to start a bigger more interesting project. This one however, I do want it to work as well as possble. I wish I could have used qwen2.5:7b instead of qwen2.5:3b, it would have been a better choice in every respect, but I could not make it fit in the Jetson Nano along with the Flask web interface. I would never suggest Eliza for anything serious, but if you just need someone to talk to, Eliza does do a pretty good imitation of an active listener and simulates empathy pretty well.
