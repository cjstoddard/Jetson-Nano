# Simple-Chat

This is a very simple Chatbot, the interesting things about it, is it uses an uncensored LLM. This means it will freely talk about anything, it will even talk dirty to you in explicit language. To get the best results for a bit of spicy chat you will need a good prompt. The system-prompt.txt file contains a prompt that testing has shown to work pretty well. You can modify the first line to suit your own preferances. Before building, open simple-chat.py and replace the SYSTEM_PROMPT section with the contents of the system-prompt.txt file. Once you build it, you should have a naughty chatbot to interact with.

This chatbot is not super great, but it works. It will carry on a reasonable conversation, just set your expectations on the low side and you will be fine.
