# Dungeons & Dragons SRD Dungeon Masters Assistant

This is an extension of the rag project. I managed to work out how to use a larger model and added a database for storing the indexed information, so it persists after restarts. Nerds being nerds, I decided the best use for this was as a D&D rules assistant. You can either upload the [D&D 5E SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) or you can point it towards the [5E SRD website](https://www.5esrd.com/). I would suggest uploading the PDF, I have gotten better results with it. Once it ingests the data, you can start using it. It is still not very smart, but as long as you keep your questions general, it should do all right. Asking it general questions like "Summerize the wizard class for me.", you will get a reasonably good answer. However asking it a specific question like "What is the Fighter classes 2nd level class ability?" and you will get nonsense. "How does the Fireball spell work?" is good, "How much damage does a Fireball do?" is not good.
