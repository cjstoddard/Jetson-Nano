# Dungeons & Dragons SRD Dungeon Masters Assistant

This is an extension of the rag project. I managed to work out how to use a larger model and added a database for storing the indexed information, so it persists after restarts. Nerds being nerds, I decided the best use for this was as a D&D rules assistant. You can either upload the [D&D 5E SRD](https://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf) or you can point it towards the [5E SRD website](https://www.5esrd.com/). I would suggest uploading the PDF, better yet, get the [Markdown version](https://github.com/oznogon/cc-srd5/blob/main/cc-srd5.md) of the SRD. These A.I. models seem to love markdown for some reason or another.


It is still not very smart, these small models basically suck. Just remember all of these projects are simply starting points for better tools.
